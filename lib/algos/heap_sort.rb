# Sorts an array
#
# Heap sort is another comparison sort - and the most optimal time complexity for a comparison sort is O(nlogn),
# which is (coincidentally) the running time for heap sort.
#
# - in place
# - uses a heap data structure, which also makes for a good priority queue implementation
#
# PERFORMANCE: O(nlogn)
